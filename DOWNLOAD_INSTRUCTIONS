The files in this repository are the files that run the CARMA Data Reduction Pipeline. They exist in 2 forms: the raw python files which are the current development version and the pipelineFiles.tar.gz file, which contains the current active version of the pipeline files.

In general it is recommended you download the pipelineFiles.tar.gz file as is will be stable and functional, while the development files may not be.
